    *
    * A release-looking `version` (`ShellVersion.isRelease`) extracts once,
    * keyed by the directory being *complete* — present with every indexed
    * flow file — not merely existing; a second call is then a no-op, since a
    * release's flows are immutable for that version. Any other version (a
    * dev snapshot or `"dev"` itself) always re-extracts and rewrites each
    * flow's `//> using dep "org.virtuslab::orca:X"` line to the running
    * `version`, inserting `//> using repository ivy2Local` right after it —
    * the same treatment `_seed_lib.sh --local` applies, so built-ins resolve
    * against a locally published build instead of a not-yet-released Maven
    * Central artifact.
    *
    * Both paths write through [[materialize]], which stages every file in a
    * temp sibling directory and swaps it into place with an atomic move —
    * `ProgressStore.writeLog`'s temp-file-then-`os.move` idiom, applied to a
    * directory. A process killed mid-extraction (OOM, `kill -9`, disk full)
    * can therefore only ever leave the temp directory (never looked at again)
    * half-written, never `dir` itself; combined with the completeness check,
    * a legacy half-populated `dir` left by the old existence-keyed logic is
    * treated as absent and self-heals on the next call.
