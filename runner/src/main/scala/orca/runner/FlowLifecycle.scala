    * `flow()` never exits without an explanation. The body phase additionally
    * runs `teardownFailure` on the way out.
    *
    * Success path runs `teardownSuccess` OUTSIDE `surfaced`, deliberately: it
    * is already internally best-effort (every leg is wrapped in `bestEffort`,
    * so nothing `NonFatal` can escape it), and wrapping a phase that can't fail

    * successful run instead of the silent cosmetic failure `teardownSuccess`'s

    * plus one best-effort phase, not four bracketed ones.
